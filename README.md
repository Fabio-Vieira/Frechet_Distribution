# Frechet_Distribution

A Gibbs sampling estimation, with a Metropolis-Hastings step, of the two-parameter Fréchet distribution using the Jeffreys prior.

I also write my own function to generate Fréchet random variates using the inverse transform sampling method, because I couldn't 
find a function to do that in R. Apparently there is a package called "extRemes", but I couldn't get it to work.
